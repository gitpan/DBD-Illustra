This is version 0.03 of DBD::Illustra. It is nowhere near complete yet,
but provides metadata, and is starting to include more than bare-bones
functionality.

Binding of input parameters is not yet supported because the underlying
database API does not support it. I hope to work around this at some point.

Blobs are not yet explicity supported

INSTALLING

What you need to install this module:
	Perl version 5.004 or later
	DBI version 1.0 or later
	Illustra client library and include files
	An ANSI C compiler

If the environment variable $MI_HOME is not set, Makefile.PL will look in a
couple of likely places (currently /opt/illustra and /usr/local/illustra). It
is looking for the directories $MI_HOME/lib/ and $MI_HOME/h/ for libraries
and include files, respectively. If these directories aren't found, you won't
be able to compile the module.

With $MI_HOME set or using the default, type 'perl Makefile.PL' to build
the makefile and 'make' to build the module. 'make install' will install.

TESTING

DBD::Illustra uses Jochen Wiedmann's test suite. Before running the test you
should set the environment variables DBI_DSN, DBI_USER and DBI_PASS to give
write access to a database on your system.
DBI_DSN defaults to dbi:Illustra:test
