This is version 0.04 of DBD::Illustra.

Changes from version 0.03:
  * Included dbd-illustra.pod. This is the text describing Illustra from
    Tim Bunce and Alligator Descartes' book about DBI, although it's not
    going to be included now, due to Illustra's unpopularity
  * Support for bind parameters
  * Support for reading large objects
  * Return correct number of rows in all cases
  * Partial $sth->{TYPE} support

INSTALLING

What you need to install this module:
	Perl version 5.004 or later
	DBI version 1.0 or later
	Illustra client library and include files
	An ANSI C compiler

If the environment variable $MI_HOME is not set, Makefile.PL will look in a
couple of likely places (currently /opt/illustra and /usr/local/illustra). It
is looking for the directories $MI_HOME/lib/ and $MI_HOME/h/ for libraries
and include files, respectively. If these directories aren't found, you won't
be able to compile the module.

With $MI_HOME set or using the default, type 'perl Makefile.PL' to build
the makefile and 'make' to build the module. 'make install' will install.

TESTING

DBD::Illustra uses Jochen Wiedmann's test suite. Before running the test you
should set the environment variables DBI_DSN, DBI_USER and DBI_PASS to give
write access to a database on your system.
DBI_DSN defaults to dbi:Illustra:test
