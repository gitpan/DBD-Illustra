This is version 0.02 of DBD::Illustra. It is nowhere near complete yet,
but provides metadata, and is starting to include more than bare-bones
functionality.

Binding of input parameters is not yet supported because the underlying
database API does not support it. I hope to work around this at some point.

Error reporting is somewhat ropey at present. The standard $DBI::err,
$DBI::errstr, $DBI::state variables are not yet poopulated. However, all
errors generated by the driver are output as warnings, so $SIG{__WARN__}
will catch them.


INSTALLING

What you need to install this module:
	Perl version 5.004 or later
	DBI version 1.0 or later
	Illustra client library and include files
	An ANSI C compiler

If the environment variable $MI_HOME is not set, Makefile.PL will look in a
couple of likely places (currently /opt/illustra and /usr/local/illustra). It
is looking for the directories $MI_HOME/lib/ and $MI_HOME/h/ for libraries
and include files, respectively. If these directories aren't found, you won't
be able to compile the module.

With $MI_HOME set or using the default, type 'perl Makefile.PL' to build
the makefile and 'make' to build the module. 'make install' will install.
There aren't really any useful tests yet, so don't expect 'make test' to
do anything useful.
