This is the very first (pre-)release of DBD::Illustra. It is nowhere near
complete yet, but does provide the minimum functionality to be able to
perform selects and updates, so long as you don't care about metadata.

The main reason for this release is to get some feedback from other driver
developers to make sure that I'm heading down the right track with this.
