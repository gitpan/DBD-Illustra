=head2 General Information

=head3 Version

Version 0.04.

=head3 Author and Contact Details

The driver author is Peter Haworth.  He can be contacted via the
I<dbi-users> mailing list, although direct mail to
I<pmh@edison.ioppublishing.com> is likely to be read more quickly.


=head3 Supported Database Versions and Options

The C<DBD::Illustra> module supports Illustra version 3.3.1.
Other versions may be supported, but have not been tested.

The Illustra database is being absorbed into the Informix database
after Informix bought the company.  Since Illustra is no longer being
developed or supported, it's a bit hard to find online information.

=head3 Differences from the DBI Specification

No significant differences.

Note that Illustra does not parse the statement until it's executed. This means
that attributes like C<$sth-E<gt>{NUM_OF_FIELDS}> are not available until after
C<$sth-E<gt>execute> has been called. This is valid
behaviour but is important to note when porting applications
originally written for other drivers.


=head2 Connect Syntax

The C<DBI-E<gt>connect()> Data Source Name, or I<DSN>, must be in the following
format:

  dbi:Illustra:dbname

There are no driver-specific attributes for the C<DBI-E<gt>connect()> method.

C<DBD::Illustra> supports 32 concurrent database connections to one or
more databases.

However, only one statement handle per database
handle may be executing concurrently. So you can prepare a new one but
not execute it. This applies to all statements, whether DML or DDL.


=head2 Data Types

=head3 Numeric Data Handling

Illustra supports the following numeric data types:

  INT1             - 1 byte signed integer
  SMALLINT         - 2 byte signed integer
  INTEGER          - 4 byte signed integer
  NUMERIC          - fixed point number, precision=15, scale=0
  NUMERIC(p)       - fixed point number, precision=p, scale=0
  NUMERIC(p,s)     - fixed point number, precision=p, scale=s
  DECIMAL          - NUMERIC
  DECIMAL(p)       - NUMERIC(p)
  DECIMAL(p,s)     - NUMERIC(p,s)
  REAL             - single precision floating point number
  DOUBLE PRECISION - double precision floating point number

There is no documented limit on either the precision or scale of NUMERIC and
DECIMAL types, except that neither may be negative and the scale may not be
less than the precision.

C<DBD::Illustra> always returns all numbers as strings, so it supports
numbers outside the valid range for Perl numbers.


=head3 String Data Handling

Illustra supports the following string data types:

  CHAR1           - single character
  CHAR(size)      - fixed length string
  CHARACTER(size) - fixed length string
  VARCHAR(size)   - variable length string
  TEXT            - variable length string, up to 8KB
  LARGE_TEXT      - text, may be greater than 8KB

The 8KB mentioned above is the size of a page in Illustra. The combined size of
all data in a single row may not exceed the page size. The LARGE_TEXT type uses
a large object held outside the page to store the data.

CHAR and VARCHAR types don't appear to have a size limit other than the page
size. 

The CHAR and CHARACTER types are fixed length and blank padded.

Illustra doesn't seem to notice or care when the 8th bit is set. The
8th bit is preserved as entered.  Unicode UTF-8 strings can be stored
but strings with embedded NUL characters can't.

Strings can be concatenated using the C<||> operator.

=head3 Date Data Handling

Illustra supports the SQL2 datetime data types and intervals:

  DATE            - single day resolution, from 1 AD to 9999 AD
  TIME            - one second resolution, from 00:00:00 to 23:59:61
  TIME(p)         - p digits of fractional seconds (max 8 digits)
  TIMESTAMP       - microsecond resolution, from 1 AD to 9999 AD
  TIMESTAMP(p)    - p digits of fractional seconds (max 8 digits)

The TIME, TIME(p), TIMESTAMP(p) and TIMESTAMP(p) types all accept a
"WITH TIME ZONE" modifier.

The default output formats for datetime types are:

  DATE                      YYYY-MM-DD
  TIME                      HH:MM:SS[.NNNNNNNN]
  TIME WITH TIME ZONE       HH:MM:SS[.NNNNNNNN]+HH:MM
  TIMESTAMP                 YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.NNNNNNNN]
  TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE  YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.NNNNNNNN]+HH:MM

The default output format cannot be changed.
Note that the timezone offsets may be negative (C<-HH:MM>) as well as
positive.

Individual components of dates and times may be extracted using the EXTRACT
function: C<EXTRACT(field FROM date_value)>, where I<field> may be one of
YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND, TIMEZONE_HOUR, or TIMEZONE_MINUTE.

The default input formats for all the above types are the same as the output
format. Only those formats are recognized.  Literal values must be quoted.
All parts of dates and times must be specified.  So two digit years,
for example, are not permitted.

To get the correct date and time, the literal string C<'now'> may be type cast
to any of the above types using a "::type" notation:

  'now'::date
  'now'::time
  'now'::timestamp

Functions are also available:

  current_date
  current_time
  current_time(precision)
  current_timestamp
  current_timestamp(precision)

For DATE, the two methods are equivalent. However, for TIME and TIMESTAMP,
C<'now'> does not include the timezone, whereas the C<current_*()> functions 
do. If an
integer argument is passed to the C<current_*()> functions, it indicates the number
of digits of fractional seconds to display. The default for C<current_time()> is 0,
with a maximum of 8. The default for C<current_timestamp()> is 6, with a maximum
of 8.

Illustra supports the SQL2 datetime data types and intervals:

  INTERVAL start[(p1[,p2])] [TO end[(p3)]]

The following interval qualifications are possible:

  YEAR, YEAR TO MONTH,
  MONTH,
  DAY, DAY TO HOUR, DAY TO MINUTE, DAY TO SECOND,
  HOUR, HOUR TO MINUTE, HOUR TO SECOND,
  MINUTE, MINUTE TO SECOND,
  SECOND

Where I<p1> specifies the number of digits specified in the value, with a
maximum of 10 and a default of 2. I<p2> and I<p3> specify the number of
digits specified in fractional seconds, with a maximum of 8 and a
default of 0.

Literal interval values may be specified using the following syntax:

  INTERVAL value start[(p1,[p2])] [TO end[(p3)]]

e.g.:

  INTERVAL '2' DAY
  INTERVAL '02:03' HOUR TO MINUTE
  INTERVAL '12345:67.891' MINUTE(5) TO SECOND(3)

A full range of operations can be performed on dates and intervals,
I<e.g.>, datetime-datetime=interval, datetime+interval=datetime,
interval/number=interval.

The following SQL expression can be used to convert an integer "seconds
since 1-jan-1970 GMT" value to the corresponding database date time:

  'epoch'::ABSTIME::TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL seconds_since_epoch SECOND(10)

The following SQL expression can be used to go the other way, to
convert a database date time value into a "seconds since 1-jan-1970
GMT" value:

  (date_time_field - 'epoch'::ABSTIME::TIMESTAMP) INTERVAL SECOND(10)

No time zone adjustments are perfomed on values of TIME WITH TIME ZONE
or TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE data types. Their time zones are output as
they were entered.

Normal TIME and TIMESTAMP values are treated as being in the current
time zone of the current client. They are converted to GMT when stored
in the database and converted back to the current clients time zone
when fetched.  For example:

  CREATE TABLE tz_demo (loctime TIME, tztime TIME WITH TIME ZONE);

  SET TIME ZONE INTERVAL '3:00' HOUR TO MINUTE;
  INSERT INTO tz_demo VALUES('12:40:00','12:40:00+03:00');

  SELECT * FROM tz_demo;
       loctime    tztime
       12:40:00   12:40:00+03:00

  SET TIME ZONE INTERVAL '0:00' HOUR TO MINUTE;
  SELECT * FROM tz_demo;
       loctime    tztime
       09:40:00   12:40:00+03:00


=head3 LONG/BLOB Data Handling

Illustra supports the following large object types:

  LARGE_OBJECT    - Binary large object
  LARGE_TEXT      - Large object masquerading as normal text
  EXTERNAL_FILE   - Locator for external large binary file

The maximum size of large objects is not documented by Illustra
but is probably 4GB.
None of the types are passed to and from the database as pairs of hex digits.

The I<LongReadLen> and I<LongTruncOk> attributes are untested as yet.

LARGE_TEXT fields may be treated just like any other fields, but LARGE_OBJECT
fields and EXTERNAL_FILE fields must be updated with Illustra's C<FileToLO()>
SQL function. LARGE_OBJECT and EXTERNAL_FILE fields may be read using Illustra's
C<LOToFile()> SQL function, or their contents may be read using the non-standard
C<read_large_object> method after the query has been finished:

  my $sth=$dbh->prepare('SELECT lofield FROM tab1 where key=?');
  $sth->execute($key);
  my($lohandle)=$sth->fetchrow_array;
  $sth->finish;

  my $offset=0;
  my $locontent;
  while(defined(my $frag=$dbh->func($lohandle,$offset,4096,'read_large_object'))){
    length $frag or last;
    $locontent.=$frag;
  }


=head3 Other Data Handling issues

The C<DBD::Illustra> driver does not currently support the C<type_info()> method. This
is under development, but Illustra doesn't generally provide enough information
to make this particularly useful.

Illustra automatically converts dates to strings, strings to dates, and
strings to numbers, but numbers must be explicitly converted to strings:

  INSERT INTO foo (num_field, str_field) VALUES ('42', 42::text)


=head2 Transactions, Isolation and Locking

Illustra and C<DBD::Illustra> support transactions.
The default transaction isolation level is Serializable.

Illustra supports all four standard isolation levels: Serializable,
Repeatable Read, Read Commited, and Read Uncommited.  The level be changed
per-transaction by executing a C<SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL x>
statement where I<x> is the name of the isolation level required.

The default locking behavior is for readers to block writers.

Rows returned by a SELECT statement can be locked to prevent them from
being changed
by another transaction, by including "LOCK=EXCLUSIVE" or "LOCK=UPDATE" in the
optimizer hints for a given table:

  SELECT * FROM xyz USING(LOCK=UPDATE) WHERE xid = 'abc'

Exclusive locks provide less concurrency, but update locks must be
upgraded to exclusive when updates are required. This can cause
deadlock if another transaction has acquired a read lock in the
meantime.

There doesn't seem to be any way to explicitly lock a table other than
by issuing a dummy SELECT statement with a LOCK=EXCLUSIVE hint as above.


=head2 SQL Dialect

=head3 Case Sensitivity of LIKE Operator

The Illustra LIKE operator is case sensitive.


=head3 Table Join Syntax

Illustra does not support outer joins, but normal, inner
joins are supported with the standard syntax.


=head3 Table and Column Names

The maximum size of table and column names appears to be 212 characters.
The first character must be a letter, but the rest can be any
combination of letters, numerals and underscores (_).

However, if an Illustra identifier is enclosed by double quotation
marks (C<">), it can contain any combination of characters, including
spaces. Double quotes in identifier names must be escaped with another
double quote, e.g, C<"double""quote">.

Identifiers are stored as entered. All identifiers are case sensitive.
National character set characters can be used if enclosed in double
quotation marks.


=head3 Row ID

The Illustra "row ID" pseudocolumn is called I<oid>.  Illustra I<oid>'s look
like "2d52.2001".  I<Oid>'s can be treated as a string and used to rapidly
(re)select rows.


=head3 Automatic Key or Sequence Generation

Illustra does not support automatic key generation such as "auto
increment" or "system generated" keys.

It also doesn't offer sequence generators.


=head3 Automatic Row Numbering and Row Count Limiting

Neither automatic row numbering nor row count limitations are supported.


=head3 Positioned updates and deletes

Illustra supports positioned updates or deletes in cursors that have been
explicitly created and opened C<FOR UPDATE>. For example:

  $dbh->do("DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM tab1 FOR UPDATE");
  $dbh->do("OPEN cur1");
  $sth = $dbh->prepare("FETCH NEXT FROM cur1");
  while ($sth->execute && $row = $sth->fetchrow_arrayref) {
      $dbh->do("UPDATE tab1 SET col2='zyx' WHERE CURRENT OF cur1");
  }

The statements must all occur within the same transaction.


=head2 Parameter Binding

Parameter binding is not supported by Illustra, but the driver emulates
the binding of C<?> style input parameters. The TYPE attribute of the
C<bind_param()> method is ignored - Illustra accepts quoted literals
for all types.


=head2 Stored Procedures

The closest match to stored procedures that Illustra supports is user
defined functions. These may be used just like system defined functions
in SELECT or RETURN statements:

  $sth = $dbh->prepare("RETURN foo('bar')");
  $sth->execute();
  @result = $sth->fetchrow_array();


=head2 Table Metadata

C<DBD::Illustra> supports the C<table_info()> method. However, since the information
comes from Illustra's "tables" table, C<table_info()> will only return useful
information if "tables" is readable. By default, only the DBA has access to
"tables".

The "columns" table contains detailed information about all columns of
all the table in the database, one row per table. However, the same access
restrictions described above for the "tables" table will probably apply.

The "tables" and "columns" tables contain information about indexes as well
as normal tables. Use C<tables.table_kind='i'> for index tables (and C<'t'> 
for normal tables).

The C<tables.table_unique> field holds an array of column numbers. Each
unique constraint, including the primary key, is held as a -1 terminated
list of column numbers. The primary key is always the first list, even
if it is not present.

  (no constraints)                   =>  '[]'
  primary key(c1,c2)                 =>  '[1,2,-1]'
  primary key(c1,c2),unique(c1,c3)   =>  '[1,2,-1,1,3,-1]'
  unique(c1,c3)                      =>  '[-1,1,3,-1]'

These arrays are returned as strings although you can retrieve
individual elements instead using SQL functions.


=head2 Driver-specific Attributes and Methods

C<DBD::Illustra> has no significant driver-specific handle attributes or
private methods.
