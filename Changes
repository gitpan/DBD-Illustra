  Added table_info support (not that dbish seems to notice)
  Have a go at implementing $h->errstr and $h->state ($h->err is useless)
    - callbacks no longer warn
  Add mostly empty dbd_bind_ph and completely empty dbd_st_blob_read
  Pathetic attempt at supporting {TYPE} info. Illustra doesn't help
